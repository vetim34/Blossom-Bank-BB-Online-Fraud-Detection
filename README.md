# Blossom-Bank-BB-Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection

## Problem Statement
Blossom Bank also known as BB PLC is a multinational financial services group, that offers retail and investment banking, pension management, asset management and payments services, headquartered in London,UK.

Blossom Bank wants to build a Machine Learning model to predict online payment fraud. With this model they expect to make less False Negatives with regards to detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Project Objective
Visualize the relationships of the columns within the dataset (EDA).
Find out what machine learning (ML) model will detect frauds better.
Decide which confusion matrix metric is important for deciding the model.

## Model creation procedure:
1. I imported the visualization libraries, ranging from pandas to numpy, seaborn and matplotlib.
2. Imported the csv file of the dataset.
3. Carried out dataset inspection to ensure my data analysis is accurate and trustworthy.
4. Located the target, y.
5. Assigned features to X for training and testing of dataset.
6. Performing a data train_test_split.
7. Import the algorithms for the model from the sklearn library.
8. Training model with 80% and testing with 20% ratio.
9. Visualizing confusion matrix to help make best decision with regards to which model to select.

## Challenges
- Many times my kernel wasn't responding even when it was interrupted, and it took a great deal of time to rectify. I basically had to close the browser window.
- Sometimes, there was a need to do a lot of plots to find out which best presented an interpretable result.

## But overall, this was fun!!!!!!
